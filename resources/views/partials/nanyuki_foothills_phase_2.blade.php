                    <h3>Nanyuki Foothills Phase 2</h3>
                    <p>Nanyuki phase 2 is located 17 km from Nanyuki CBD along the Nanyuki - Rumuruti road, and these are already sold out. The plots are accessible at the Ol Pejeta conservancy gate B junction. The parcels are 500m from the main road, located 200 meters from the 800 acre proposed Enaai golf course estate. The land neighbors other prominent developments like Mt. Kenya Wildlife Estate (4 km), Maiyan Housing Development, Mukima Ridge and British military bungalows.

                        The land is divided into 1/8th acre plots. Its location provides captivating views of Mt. Kenya, Aberdare ranges and the Lolldaiga hills. Due to the property's close proximity to the main road the plots can be used for multiple purposes, and have value additions like water and electricity. Public transport is also available in the area.</p>
